Welcome to the Ciel Coins Solidity Contract repository! This repository contains the smart contract code for Ciel Coins, the ERC-20 token powering EcoCiel's sustainable reward ecosystem. Developed on the Ethereum blockchain, Ciel Coins incentivize environmentally-friendly behavior and promote sustainability initiatives within the EcoCiel platform.

### Deflationary Mechanism

CielCoins (CCN) feature a deflationary mechanism designed to reduce the token supply over time. With each transaction, a portion of the tokens is burned, effectively decreasing the total supply. This deflationary pressure encourages holders to hold onto their tokens rather than sell them, thereby increasing scarcity and potentially driving up the value of CCN over time.


## Caution: This is just a test repository for contracts and have been not yet been implemented fully and connected with main system. This is just for illustration purposes although we have deployed the contract
